This website is an older project that I add made a while back. Currently, I'm trying to publish all of my old and new projects to Github so that I can easily keep track of them and in case I want to revisit them.

# BMI & Sum Calculator

This web application provides two functionalities: a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator and a simple sum calculator. It utilizes Node.js for routing purposes, offering a seamless user experience. 
This was made with HTML only, it has no CSS simply because I found no reason in using it for such a simple project, and the course I was doing at the time( which taught me how to do this) didn't do it either so I considered that to be the best choice

## Features

- Calculate BMI based on height and weight
- Perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Node.js routing for efficient handling of requests

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator-app.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd calculator-app`
4. Install dependencies: `npm install`
5. Start the server: `node server.js`
6. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
7. Use the provided links or navigation to access the BMI calculator or the simple sum calculator.
